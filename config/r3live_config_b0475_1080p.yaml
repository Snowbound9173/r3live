   # lio_update_point_step: This parameter determines the point step used for the LIO update. A smaller value means that more points will be used in the LIO update process, potentially improving the accuracy of the pose estimation. However, this may also increase the computational cost.
   lio_update_point_step: 1   # default = 1   
   # max_iteration: This parameter specifies the maximum number of LIO Extended State Information Kalman Filter (ESIKF) iterations. Increasing this number may lead to better convergence and potentially more accurate pose estimation. However, it will also increase the computational cost.
   max_iteration: 24           # default = 2 | 24 was OK too
   # lidar_time_delay: This parameter is used to provide a time-offset between the LiDAR and the IMU. A correct time synchronization is crucial for accurate pose estimation. If you are certain that there is no time delay between the LiDAR and the IMU, you can leave this value at zero. Otherwise, you might need to experiment with this parameter to find the optimal time-offset that gives the best results.
   lidar_time_delay: 0        # default = 0  The time-offset between LiDAR and IMU, provided by user. 
   # filter_size_corner: This parameter is related to the edge (corner) feature extraction from the input point cloud. The filter size determines the neighborhood size for edge feature extraction. A smaller value will result in a smaller neighborhood, potentially giving more precise features, but may also lead to more noise. A larger value will result in a larger neighborhood, which could smooth out noise but might result in less precise features.
   filter_size_corner: 0.05   # default = 0.30  | good = 0.125 tried to lower to filter tighter corners
   # filter_size_surf: This parameter is related to the planar (surface) feature extraction from the input point cloud. Similar to filter_size_corner, a smaller value will result in a smaller neighborhood and potentially more precise features, while a larger value might smooth out noise but give less precise features. 
   filter_size_surf: 0.10    # default = 0.30  | good = 0.125 | tried to lower to filter tighter surfaces
   # filter_size_surf_z: This parameter is an additional filter size specific to the z-axis for planar (surface) feature extraction. Adjusting this value will similarly affect the precision and noise in the extracted planar features. 
   filter_size_surf_z: 0.10   # default = 0.30  | good = 0.125 | tried to lower to filter tighter surfaces
   # filter_size_map: This parameter is related to the filtering of the global map. A smaller value will result in a denser point cloud map, while a larger value will lead to a sparser map. It's important to find a balance between map density and computational cost.
   filter_size_map: 0.05      # default = 0.30  | good = 0.125 | tried to lower to filter tighter map
   # fov_degree: Probably the FOV of the lidar? Lets test.

   # voxel_downsample_size_axis_z: not sure
   voxel_downsample_size_axis_z: 0.00025     # default = 0.10 | good = 0.05? fewest errors |good = 0.02? -- does lower make this more clear? ill invert to test. That was worse
   # planar_check_dis: not sure
   planar_check_dis: 0.1                  # default 0.10
   #long_rang_pt_dis: not sure. If you thought this was about how far to publish a viewed point? No. It's not a filter. Decreasing this seems to have changed frame time from 100 to 300ms
   long_rang_pt_dis: 500                  # default 500 | Considering lowering this to like 50m? | testing 5 not good | testing 5000 fine.
   #cube_side_length: not sure
   cube_side_length: 1e+5                 # default = 1e+07  | Not sure -- but maybe increasing this to 1e+10 was good? UI'll try 1e+5 and review
   #maximum_pt_kdtree_dis
   maximum_pt_kdtree_dis: 0.4             # default = 0.5 | tired to half kdtree_dis in case that keeps kdtree 'tighter' was ok. 0.1 was bad. 1.0 was bad.
   #maximum_res_dis
   maximum_res_dis: 0.3                   # default = 0.3 | can't tell what this does
